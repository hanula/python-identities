python-identities
-----------------

Main goal is to simplify connecting various data entities via abstract identities.

Possible use cases
------------------

* Generic user authentication with encrypted password for any DB based application.
* Token identity to identify and verify resources via autogenerated tokens.
* Identify users with external account identities (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Github).


TODO
----
* Add more abstracted identity<>resource connectors (for example to use in DB model)
